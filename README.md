**Cyber Wonderland** is an immersive escape room based on _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_ by Lewis Carroll, and the animated adaptation for Disney. This project was created for the module DAT661 Realtime, in BA(Hons) Digital Media Design, at the University of Plymouth. It was created by Group 3: Leanne, Kaye, and Isaac.

## Narrative
In the escape room, players encounter Alice, who asks the players help. The Queen of Hearts has lost her jewels… but they are not in Wonderland, they are in the real world! Alice enlists the players help to find them and send the jewels back to Wonderland. To find the jewels, players must search around the environment. Here they encounter a talking plant, a number of lockboxes, a rotary phone, playing cards, an unusual dictionary and more. 

## Technology Stack

This project uses a combination of technologies:

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js and Express for backend development
- P5.js for interactive elements
- Arduino for physical props in the escape room
